# MiniJava-Compiler

Design and implementation of a compiler for the MiniJava language (a small subset of Java). This project was implemented for 
the course of Compilers, in Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, at University of Athens, Greece. In each of the 
3 parts, there is a readme file that explains everything in detail.

To implement the compiler, the tools JavaCC and JTB are used.
